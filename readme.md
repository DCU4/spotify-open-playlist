# Spotify Open Playlist

This page allows you to add songs to a open playlist on my personal Spotify. You might also be able to see what I am currently listening to (if I am listening!).

This is built with Node.js using the Spotify API. Currently you are able to:

 - Add songs the playlist, which also adds to my queue
 - Search Spotify by song/artist/album
 - View the current song I am listening to
 - See the full open playlist

Check it out for yourself!
